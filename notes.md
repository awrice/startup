# CS 260 Notes

## GitHub
Main functionality of git is to make sure all our code is saved in the cloud, and also that we can collaborate with others. 

Using the `git clone [git repo URL]` command will give you a new copy of the repo, and you'll commit, push, and pull as you work through all your code. Easy enough!
